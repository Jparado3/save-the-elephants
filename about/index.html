  <h2>Why save the elephants?</h2>
  <p class="column" class="border">Elephants play an important role in the enviroment. During dry seasons,
    elephants have a way in finding water by digging into the ground with
    their tusk, also providing water for other animals.
  Elephants create huge gaps in the vegetation they eat in. These gaps create new
pathways for other animals use, allowing the terrain to open up more. In fact, their dung contains
seeds from their past meals, enabling new grass and other trees to grow. This helps
the ecosystem stay healthy.</p>
